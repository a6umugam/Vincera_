            <h2>Vision and Mission</h2>
            <p>As children get older, it can be a challenge for them to get adequate daily physical activity. So we believe in inculcating sports from early childhood of a kid. Vincera Sports will become a organization where the spirit of sport is sown as a seed within kids from the younger age, which will make them achieve great heights in the field of sports.</p>

            <h2>Marathon Trials</h2>
            <p>We train enthusiasts for half marathon and full marathon. We train in groups outdoors in natural surroundings, providing you the opportunity to connect with nature and to meet and associate with like-minded people.</p>
            <p>Marathon running is typically accompanied by a specific training program. Runners may use a program that calls for four to six workouts per week, but there are times when you can only run three days per week. Running only three days per week has several benefits, including preventing injuries and overtraining, along with providing extra time for strength training workouts or recreational sports. Even though your schedule limits your training to three days per week, you can still cross the finish line of your next marathon.</p>

            <h2>Beep Test</h2>
            <p>The beep test is a physical fitness test of your aerobic fitness. To significantly improve your beep test score, you need to do specific and general aerobic type training. Although the aerobic energy system is primarily being tested, as in most activities it is not the sole energy source, and the anaerobic system (or speed endurance / lactate tolerance) also plays a part in the beep test performance as the speed increases and effort is required to slow down and accelerate away from each turn.</p>
